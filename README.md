## Data Source

The [data source](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) is the repository maintained by the Center of Systems Science and Engineering at
Johns Hopkins University. It is the same data source used to power the very famous [COVID dashboard](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6)

## Overview

Streamlit offers a beautiful UI to create data apps very easily. I was able to create the
side menu just using one line of code.

```python
import streamlit as st

st.sidebar.radio("Navigate", 
                 ["Home", "Data",
                  "Dashboard", "About", 
                  "Contribute"])
```

Similarly, one can create dropdowns, checkboxes and a bunch of other UI designs.
 ```python
import streamlit as st

st.sidebar.selectbox("Granularity", ["Worldwide", "Country"])

```

The graphs were created using plotly. Since streamlit supports multiple graphical libraries, rendering plotly 
chart were very easy. Just pass the plotly figure object into the `st.plotly_chart()` function.

```python
import streamlit as st
import plotly.express as px

fig = px.bar(x=df["X"], 
             y=df["Y"])

st.plotly_chart(fig)
```
